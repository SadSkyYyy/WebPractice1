<BR>ALOHADANCE started into the professional Dota 2 scene in late 2013 by playing on FlipSid3 Tactics and then Hellraisers. He played for Team Empire as a stand-in for a period of time after officially being added to the Empire roster in 31st December 2014. He became known to the Dota 2 scene outside CIS after playing on the TI5 Team Empire roster. Empire did fairly well for an underdog team in the group stage, securing an upper bracket spot by winning a tie-breaker match against their CIS rivals Virtus.Pro 2-1. In the main event they lost to LGD Gaming in the upper bracket and MVP Phoenix in the lower bracket knocking them out of the tournament. ALOHADANCE continued to play on Empire until Dota Pit League/Season 4.
